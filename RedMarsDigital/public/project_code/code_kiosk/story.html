						<p>Jo and Dave each knew since childhood that they wanted to spend their life working with animals, and both shared a dream of opening their own zoo one day.</p>

					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal1">
						<p>Several years (and two children) later, with Dave still working at Chester Zoo, the Marsdens started to seriously look for opportunities to go into business for themselves.</p>
						<p>Without any external funding or outside investment, money was extremely tight - and suitable places to build a new zoo from scratch were not exactly easy to find!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal2">
						<p>At the time Jo and Dave's concept was very different to the Lakeland Wildlife Oasis, however. The original plan was to build an 'interactive aquarium', with educational and hands-on exhbits displayed alongside marine life.</p>
						<p>In 1988, after spending several weeks driving around the coast of England and Wales looking for a suitable site, they came across their first real opportunity - a good-sized plot of land in Gwynedd, North Wales, near a small beach called <span class="popupLink" id="popuplink-dinasmap">Dinas Dinlle</span>.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal3">

						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal4">
						<p>Although situated in an undeniably scenic part of the world, in many ways the site was however somewhat less than perfect!</p>
						<p>The location was remote, part of the site of the former Air Force base RAF Llandwrog (more recently redeveloped and restored to use as Caernarfon Airport).</p>
						<p>The land itself was overgrown and desolate, containing only a flock of bemused sheep and a cluster of abandoned ex-Air Force buildings... really little more than ruins!</p>
						<p>Apart from a few more disused military buildings and other remnants of the former RAF station scattered around the area, there was little else nearby.</p>

						<p>Unfortunately - or so it seemed at the time - the planning application for the Dinas Dinlle aquarium was turned down.</p>
						<p>Jo and Dave appealed the decision, but without success. Reluctantly, they prepared to sell the site and went back to the drawing board.</p>
						<p>In retrospect, however, given the 1998 opening of the £12 million Blue Planet aquarium in Ellesmere Port (just over 60 miles away from Dinas Dinlle), as well as the rise of the hugely successful Sea Life Centre brand in the 1990s and 2000s, this was probably a blessing in disguise...!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal2">
						<p>Luckily, before too long a new opportunity presented itself.</p>
						<p>A garden plant wholesale business on the border of Cumbria and Lancashire had recently ceased trading, and was selling their premises.</p>
						<p>Excitingly, the site contained a trio of large, well-maintained greenhouses that had acted as nurseries for thousands of house and garden plants destined to be sold on to garden centres and other retailers.</p>
						<p>With a bit of work, these greenhouses would be absolutely perfect for a collection of tropical plants and animals.</p>
						<p>The aquarium plans were shelved. The Marsdens would build a zoo instead!</p>

				<div class="slide hiddenSlide" data-slide-4>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal1">
						<p>Although this new site was a very exciting prospect, there was clearly a huge amount of work to be done before it would be anywhere near ready to open to the public for the first time.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal2">
						<p>First, there was of course a great deal of 'life admin' to sort out.</p>
						<p>Jo and Dave had to uproot the family from their home outside Chester and find somewhere new to live near the seed of their new zoo - in a new area they had barely set foot in and knew very little about.</p>
						<p>The idea of living somewhere on the site itself was considered, but quickly rejected. The Wildlife Oasis was going to consume so much of their lives for the forseeable future that they both knew they would soon be thankful of having somewhere else to escape to from time to time!</p>
						<hr>
						<p>Eventually though they were ready. Dave left his job at Chester zoo, having worked there for exactly 20 years (to the day!), and the family moved to Milnthorpe, just a few miles further north along the A6, in 1991.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal3">
						<p>Transforming the trio of greenhouses from a plant nursery into tropical and butterfly halls, on a shoestring budget, took a great deal of work.</p>
						<p>Along with any friends and family that they could recruit, Jo and Dave did everything possible themselves. Contractors were called in only where it was unavoidable, such as for building the extension that would house the zoo entrance, first rooms of exhibits and gift shop.</p>
						<p>To make things just that little bit more complicated, an agreement was reached with some of the building's previous occupants for them to continue trading and running some parts of their business from the site, with building work carrying on around them, while they prepared to relocate to new premises.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

		<!-- Slide 5 -->
				<div class="slide hiddenSlide" data-slide-5>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal1">
						<p>The target date for opening the Wildlife Oasis' doors to visitors was the 1992 Easter school holidays.</p>
						<p>One early problem was how to advertise! The Oasis was still in the process of being built, and none of the exhibits would be close to finished in time to be photographed for marketing.</p>
						<p>Jo tackled this problem by painting artist's impressions of some of the Oasis' work-in-progress exhibits and soon-to-be inhabitants, as can be seen from the very first leaflet.</p>
						<figure>

							<figcaption><span class="popupLink" id="popupLink-firstLeaflet">Tap to see the full leaflet!</span></figcaption>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal2">
						<p>Another very important thing that had to be taken care of before opening was of course the animals themselves!</p>
						<hr>
						<p>Among the very first inhabitants to arrive at the Wildlife Oasis were a pair of <span class="popupLink" id="popupLink-fruitBats">Indian fruit bats</span>, called Bertie and Belinda.</p>
						<p>The bats actually arrived several months before the Oasis was to open, and in the absence of a more suitable temporary home took up their roost on the ceiling of the tropical hall while the last few weeks of building and landscaping were still in full swing.</p>
						<p>Nobody was sure what they would make of all the frantic activity going on below them, but as it turned out they can't have been overly bothered!</p>
						<p>With a few weeks still to go to opening day, a builder glancing up into the rafters spotted a tiny, furry face looking back at him. Wrapped up safely in Belinda's wings, this baby bat was the Oasis' very first birth - quickly named Barney.</p>
						<p>Other original inhabitants of the Wildlife Oasis included a couple of black rat snakes from Chester Zoo, a pair of common marmosets, a few fish and various invertebrates.</p>

						<p>Somehow, the Wildlife Oasis was <em>just</em> completed on time for its 'grand' opening.</p>
						<p>After frantically stacking the shelves of the newly-built gift shop until the small hours that morning, and with the builders carrying their workbench out the back doors as the first visitors came in the front, the Oasis opened to the public.</p>
						<p>At the time the Wildlife Oasis was considerably smaller than it is today, comprising just the first indoor rooms, butterfly hall, aquarium and tropical hall. There was no cafe, and nothing outdoors at all.</p>
						<p>As well as the animals and plants, interactive exhibits built by Jo and Dave included a 'design your own mammal' computer programme and a 'whale weighing machine', as well as the mechanical millipede seen in the leaflet.</p>

						<p>Four years later, in 1996, the Oasis opened the doors on its first serious expansion. The space to the south of the car park was opened to visitors for the first time, a major milestone in the centre's development.</p>
						<p>This new expansion hosted a large walkthrough aviary that was home to bird species such as <span class="popupLink" id="popupLink-waldrapp">Waldrapp ibis</span> and <span class="popupLink" id="popupLink-pigeon">Mauritius pink pigeon</span>, as well as the <span class="popupLink" id="popupLink-meerkatBabies">meerkat</span> enclosure (with its viewing dome) and core building of the monkey house that you see today.</p>

						<p>The winter of 2015-2016 however brought by far the worst period of floods that the Oasis had so far experienced.</p>
						<p>Weeks of torrential downpours in November brought record levels of rainfall to much of Cumbria and the North West, flooding thousands of homes and businesses in the region - including the Wildlife Oasis.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>Before these waters had fully subsided, December brought further misery in the form of Storm Desmond.</p>
						<p>At Honister Pass, just 30 miles north of the Oasis, this extratropical cyclone desposited 341mm of water on the day of 5th December alone - a new UK rain record for a 24 hour period.</p>

						<p>On the bright side however the main indoor section of the Oasis remained *just* above the high water level.

						<p>2017 marked the Oasis' 25th birthday which, <strong>for now</strong>, brings this story up to date.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>This has of course only been a short tour through the story of the Wildlife Oasis, without even a mention of many of the popular inhabitants over the years!</p>
						<p>For example, previous visitors may remember the early successes of the <span class="popupLink" id="popupLink-kowari">kowari</span> breeding programme, or the lovable <span class="popupLink" id="popupLink-rhea">rheas</span> whose paddock eventually made way for the snow leopards.</p>
						<p>And what about the ever-popular lungfish, or pacu? Or the leafcutter ants? Or axolotls? Or the huge variety of plant species that bring the tropical halls to life? There are a lot to choose from!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal2">
						<p>...but what's next for the Wildlife Oasis?</p>
						<p>Well, there's no shortage of ideas!</p>
						<p>The keepers at the Wildlife Oasis and the trustees of the Lakeland Trust for Natural Sciences are committed to helping the centre develop further, expanding on its conservation work and bringing more fascinating wildlife and educational interactive exhibits to the area.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>The biggest obstacle to these goals is of course the constant financial challenge involved in running the centre.</p>
						<p>The cost of feeding, heating and properly caring for the Wildlife Oasis' inhabitants is very high - particularly through the winter months, during which visitor numbers are of course much lower.</p>
						<p>The rate at which enclosures and exhibits deteriorate is also quite shocking! To keep the enclosures safe and looking anywhere close to their best, the maintenance, repair and rebuilding work never stops - which is of course a constant drain on the accounts.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="contentDiv revealDiv reveal3">
						<p>If you support our work, we hope you'll join us on the next stage of our journey.</p>
						<p>How can you do this?</p>
						<p>Well, the best way is to come back and visit us again! Annual passes are available, and the cost of your visit today will be refunded should you want to upgrade your entry ticket.</p>
						<p>Word of mouth support is incredibly valuable, so if you enjoyed your visit please tell your friends!</p>
						<p>If you want to contribute even further, why not sponsor your favourite animal? The Oasis also offers a 'keeper for the day' experience, and is a great destination for school trips, birthday parties or other group visits. Just ask at reception to find out more about any of these.</p>
						<p>Most of all, <span class="flashText">thank you for visiting</span> today - we hope to see you again soon!</p>
